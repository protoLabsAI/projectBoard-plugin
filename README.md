# Project Board — coding orchestration plugin

A **protoAgent plugin** that turns an idea into merged PRs: a lean 6-state board
backed by [beads-rust](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) (`br`), an **ACP spawn loop**
that dispatches a coding agent per feature into an isolated git worktree, an
adversarial **planning layer**, and a Kanban/list **console view**.

Install into any protoAgent agent from this git URL — it's not tied to any one agent.

```
backlog → ready → in_progress → in_review → done
                      │
                      └── blocked  (a flag, not a lane)
```

## See it running — a working board-driven agent

Want a complete, working example of an agent built around this plugin?
**[roxy](https://github.com/protoLabsAI/roxy)** is a protoLabs operator/orchestrator
agent that installs this plugin as its coding-orchestration layer — it's the
reference host. It consumes this repo exactly the way you would (`plugin install` +
a pinned `plugins.lock`), enables it, and ships the surrounding agent (the A2A
server, the React console the **Board** view renders in, the delegate roster the
loop dispatches against, persona, evals). Read it to see how a board-driven coding
agent is wired end to end — including a live run shipping real features through the
board to a PR — or fork it as a starting point.

## What it does

- **Board = a projection over beads** (`.beads/*.db` + git-committed JSONL) — no
  separate store, so the work graph can't drift out of sync.
- **The loop** pulls the top-priority `ready` feature → creates a disposable
  `git worktree` off `origin/<base>` → dispatches a coder (`acp` delegate) scoped to
  it → commits/pushes → opens a PR → `in_review`. A **merge webhook** sets `done`
  (and reaps the worktree); where GitHub can't reach a webhook URL, a **PR reconcile
  poll** (`merge_poll`, on by default) drives the terminal edges itself — merged →
  `done`, closed-unmerged → `blocked`. Set `max_concurrent > 1` to build several
  features in parallel, each in its own worktree.
- **Resilience** — every `await` in a drive is bounded (a coder dispatch is hard-capped
  by `coder_timeout_s`); **transient** failures (rate-limit / network / merge-conflict)
  retry with backoff while **capability** failures (no diff / timeout) escalate a tier
  or block; and on restart the loop **recovers** features stranded mid-build (adopt an
  already-opened PR → `in_review`, else reset → `ready`).
- **DAG + gates** — `depends_on` are `blocks` edges; a dependent stays out of the
  puller until its blocker is **merged** (foundation merge-gate). The **Ready gate**
  requires a spec, EARS acceptance criteria, and explicit `files_to_modify`.
- **Escalation (opt-in)** — with a `coders` map of >1 distinct delegate, a capability
  failure climbs a model tier (`fast→smart→reasoning`) and blocks at the top.
- **coder.solve() board seam (ADR 0064 P2/P3)** — on a fresh build, when the
  [`coder`](https://github.com/protoLabsAI/protoAgent/tree/main/plugins/coder) plugin
  is enabled AND the feature has acceptance criteria AND `coder_solve_test_cmd` (or
  `local_gate_cmd`) is set, the loop dispatches through `coder.solve()`'s
  execution-grounded ladder — greedy → best-of-k → tree-search → **fusion** — instead
  of a single `delegate_to(acp)` shot, gated on the feature's acceptance tests
  actually PASSING in a real candidate worktree, never an LLM judge. **Fusion** (rung
  4, opt-in via `coder_solve_fusion_delegate`) is a richer *generator* for the
  hardest features the cheaper rungs couldn't pass — it can't tool-call (a plain
  completion, e.g. `protolabs/fusion`, not an ACP session), so `coder_seam.py` hands
  it the current content of the feature's declared files and writes its reply's
  files into a fresh worktree itself; the SAME `verify()` oracle judges it. Composes
  WITH the tier ladder above (solve() searches *within* a tier; a search that never
  passes escalates a tier, or blocks, exactly like a no-diff dispatch). Missing
  coder/acceptance/test command ⇒ honest degrade to the single shot; missing
  `coder_solve_fusion_delegate` ⇒ the ladder simply stops at tree-search — see
  `coder_seam.py`.
- **Rung diagnostic — `POST /api/plugins/project_board/features/{id}/test-rung`**
  (operator-only, no `@tool` wrapper): runs exactly ONE named rung
  (`greedy`/`best-of-k`/`tree-search`/`fusion`) against a feature's real acceptance
  tests, in a throwaway worktree that's ALWAYS reaped — never promoted, no PR, no
  board state touched. Verifying a specific rung — fusion especially, only
  otherwise reached after three cheaper rungs fail — shouldn't require contriving a
  task hard enough to fail its way there. `{"rung": "fusion"}` in the body; `coder`
  optional (defaults to `project_board.coder`).
- **Planning layer** — two reasoning subagents (`decompose` + `antagonist`) driven by
  the `decompose-project` skill: idea → outline → MADR ADRs → epics › milestones ›
  features, hardened by an adversary, with a per-epic human gate.
- **Console view** — a Kanban + list projection over the `/features` API (ADR 0026).

It **composes** the upstream `delegates` plugin (ADR 0024/0025) for the ACP/A2A
spawn primitive — it does not reimplement it.

## Requirements

- **protoAgent ≥ 0.27.0** (console views + the ACP delegate teardown).
- **beads-rust** — the **`br`** CLI on `PATH`, the board's DAG/status store. Install
  with `cargo install beads_rust`. NOT the stale homebrew `bd` (a different, write-
  broken package); the `bd-`/`br-` prefix in issue ids is just the workspace
  namespace. Override the binary with `BR_BIN` if needed.
- `git` + the **`gh`** CLI (authenticated) for branch push + PR creation.
- The **`delegates`** plugin enabled, with an **`acp`** coder delegate declared.
  **[`proto`](https://github.com/protoLabsAI/protoCLI) is the first-class coder** —
  it's the purpose-built protoLabs coding agent, speaks ACP natively (`proto --acp`),
  and runs its full long-horizon harness (durable session-memory checkpoint,
  compaction, memory consolidation) over ACP, so it holds context across a long
  feature build. Any ACP agent works (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI), but **proto is
  the recommended default**. A reviewer `a2a` delegate is optional (review dispatch is
  off by default — most fleets review PRs via a pipeline on open).

## Install

```bash
python -m server plugin install https://github.com/protoLabsAI/projectBoard-plugin --ref main
python -m server plugin enable project_board          # the trust decision; then restart
```

Then in `config/langgraph-config.yaml`:

```yaml

## Use

- **Headless / via the agent:** `board_create_epic`, `board_create_feature`
  (`title`, `spec`, `acceptance_criteria`, `files_to_modify`, `depends_on`, …),
  `board_mark_ready`, `board_list`.
- **Plan a project:** the `decompose-project` skill ("decompose <idea>") runs the
  adversarial pipeline and populates the board.
- **HTTP API** (`/plugins/project_board/*`): `epics`, `milestones`, `features`,
  `features/{id}/{ready,dep,block,unblock,ci}`, and `/webhook/pr` (the Done edge —
  a stable public URL GitHub posts to; ungated so GitHub, which can't send a bearer,
  reaches it). `features/{id}/{cancel,test-rung}` and `DELETE features/{id}` are
  **operator-only** — no `@tool` wrapper, so the board's own lead agent has no way
  to call them.
- **Watch it:** the **Board** console view (left-rail) at
  `/plugins/project_board/board` — Kanban + list, live-refreshing, served by the
  same router as the API (so the declared view path is genuinely mounted).

## The gate — the coder's fast slice of CI

The **pre-PR gate** (`local_gate_cmd`) is the command the loop runs in each coder's
worktree before opening a PR, so the coder's own solve-loop iterates to **green**
locally instead of shipping a PR that only fails in CI.

### Two tiers — the gate is NOT a full-CI replica

| | Local gate (this) | CI |
|---|---|---|
| **Question** | "is my code correct?" | "is it releasable?" |
| **Runs** | every worktree, every attempt | once per PR |
| **Contains** | lint + typecheck + **unit** tests — fast, hermetic, deterministic | everything: integration, cross-platform matrix, image build, release, deploy |
| **Owner** | the coder's iterate loop | the human merge + the loop's CI-bounce re-dispatch |

You **never replicate a complex CI locally**. Anything needing services, secrets, a
matrix, network, or an image build stays CI-only — the PR still runs it, and whatever
the local slice didn't catch comes back to the coder via the CI-bounce. The gate's job
is to kill the cheap, common failures in seconds so the loop isn't a slow CI-bounce
casino. Getting that slice faithful matters — the failure modes are subtle (a
build-only gate compiles a test file but never runs it; a build+test gate still misses
`typecheck`, since most test runners strip types without checking them).

### `auto` — discover it, don't transcribe it

A hand-copied gate rots the moment the repo's CI changes, and is wrong the instant a
team is pointed at another repo. So:

```yaml
project_board:
  local_gate_cmd: "auto"
```

`auto` **discovers** the gate from the bound repo — **ecosystem-neutral**, keyed on how
the repo builds, always preferring a single repo-**declared** target:

1. `package.json` script `gate` / `ci` / `check` / `verify` → `pnpm run <it>` *(node)*
2. `Makefile` / `justfile` `gate` / `ci` / `check` target → `make <it>` / `just <it>`
   *(Python / Rust / Go / anything — e.g. `make gate` = `ruff check . && pytest -q`)*
3. `package.json`, none declared → `pnpm -r --if-present typecheck build test`
4. nothing recognized → gateless (fail-open, warns)

`gate` is checked **first**: it's the unambiguous "this is the fast coder slice", so a
repo whose `ci` target is the whole heavy suite points coders at `gate` and the loop
won't grab the heavy one. An explicit command overrides; blank still = no gate.

### Make your repo team-ready

Give the team **one gate target** — the fast slice — and have your own CI call the
**same** target, so local == CI by construction. Node:

```jsonc
// package.json                                   ci.yml:  - run: pnpm run gate
"scripts": { "gate": "pnpm -r typecheck && pnpm -r --if-present test" }
```
> Invoke it `pnpm run gate` — `pnpm ci`/`pnpm gate` shorthands can collide with pnpm builtins.

Python (protoAgent-shaped: a 9-workflow CI, but only `checks.yml` — ruff + pytest — is
the coder's concern; the matrix / docker-publish / release / deploy workflows are
`push`/`tag`/`dispatch` triggered and never a pre-PR gate):

```makefile
# Makefile                                        checks.yml:  - run: make gate
gate:                       ## the coder's fast slice — lint + unit tests, no services
	ruff check .
	pytest tests/ -q -m "not integration"
```

Same shape in a `justfile` (`just gate`), `nox` (`make gate` → `nox -s gate`), Cargo
(`make gate` → `cargo clippy && cargo test`), etc. The heavy jobs stay in their own
workflows; the coder never runs them.

### Preflight (fail-closed)

Before dispatching **any** work, the loop smoke-runs the resolved gate on the clean
base checkout (`preflight: true`, the default). If the gate can't even launch
(missing tool, broken deps, base already red) it **holds** all ready work — flagged
blocked, with the reason, visible on the board — rather than burn generations no coder
could pass, and re-checks each cycle so work resumes the moment it's fixed. A slow gate
that times out is treated as indeterminate → allowed (a slow gate must never wedge the
board). This is the fail-**closed** complement to the per-PR gate's fail-**open**: a
flaky gate never blocks good work, but an *unrunnable* gate never starts bad work.

## Layout

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `store.py` | the `br`/beads wrapper — board projection + the Ready/Done invariants |
| `loop.py` | the puller: `ready → worktree → coder → PR → in_review` (+ opt-in escalation) |
| `worktree.py` | per-feature worktree lifecycle, scoped coder dispatch, `open_pr` |
| `coder_seam.py` | the ADR 0064 P2 seam — dispatches a build through `coder.solve()` when available, else honest-degrades |
| `api.py` | the HTTP API + the `/webhook/pr` Done edge (HMAC-verified) |
| `board_view.py` | the Kanban/list console view |
| `retro.py` | loop-retro mining: bead attempt/outcome history → recurring failure classes (the self-improving flywheel) |
| `subagents.py` + `skills/` | the `decompose`/`antagonist` planning layer + the `loop-retro` distill skill |
| `__init__.py` | `register()` — wires it all |

Ships **disabled**; nothing runs until you enable it and declare a coder.

## Standalone scripts (outside pytest)

`from project_board import coder_seam` resolves under `pytest` because
`tests/conftest.py` registers this repo's root `__init__.py` under the name
`project_board` directly in `sys.modules` (`importlib.util.spec_from_file_location`,
`submodule_search_locations=[ROOT]`) — the repo's own directory name
(`projectBoard-plugin`) doesn't matter; no symlink, no rename needed. That
registration only happens when `conftest.py` loads, so a plain script
(`python some_smoke_test.py`, not `pytest`) needs the same few lines up front:

```python
import importlib.util
import sys
from pathlib import Path

ROOT = Path("/path/to/projectBoard-plugin")
spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location("project_board", ROOT / "__init__.py", submodule_search_locations=[str(ROOT)])
sys.modules["project_board"] = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
spec.loader.exec_module(sys.modules["project_board"])

from project_board import coder_seam, worktree  # now resolves
```

Handy for a one-off live smoke test (e.g. exercising `coder_seam.test_rung()`
against a real repo + a real delegate) without standing up a whole plugin host.

## Releasing

Releases follow the fleet cadence via [`protoLabsAI/release-tools`](https://github.com/protoLabsAI/release-tools):
**tag → LLM-themed release notes → Discord embed → GitHub release body**, wired in
`.github/workflows/release.yml`.

The version lives in `protoagent.plugin.yaml` + `pyproject.toml` (kept in lockstep by a
test) and is bumped per feature PR. To **cut a release** that batches the bumped changes
since the last tag, either:

- push a `chore: release vX.Y.Z` commit to `main`, or
- run the **Release** workflow manually — `gh workflow run release.yml` (or the Actions tab).

It tags the current version, generates notes for the range since the previous tag, posts
them to the release Discord channel, and sets the GitHub release body — idempotent
(a re-run on an already-tagged version is a no-op). Requires the org secrets
`GATEWAY_API_KEY` + `DISCORD_RELEASE_WEBHOOK`.
